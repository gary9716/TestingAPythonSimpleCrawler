#Introduction

* data source : 農業產銷資訊服務系統

* I found a way to get the list of production and sales units' data so I saved the website and parsed the list offline (parsing the "data_files/ClassSQList.html") and crawled the url list online.

* I also preserved a copy of csv(parsedData.csv encoding in UTF-8) for those who don't want to parse themselves. (data is fetched in 2015/5/12 around 5 AM GMT+8)
